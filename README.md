# Snake-Game-Using-Search-Algorithms
The project was done individually as a part of Artificial Intelligence course at the Tehran University.<br>
Three different versions of snake game is implemented each using different kind of search algorithm.<br>
Overall used search algorithms are : two of uninformed search algorithms(BFS - IDS) and informend search algorithm(A-star)
